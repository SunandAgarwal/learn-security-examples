Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

There is a possibility that when a legitimate user has logged in, a malicious attacker can access the cookie using some script from the document. Once they get access
to the session id from the cookie info, they can access the sensitive information of the logged in user.

In the secure version, while setting the session, the secret is not hardcoded and httpOnly flag is set to true, hence the cookies cannot be read programmatically.
Hence, an unauthorized script cannot just read the cookie. Also, sameSite is also set to true which means that sensitive information can only be accessed
from another endpoint if they're on the same hostname.
