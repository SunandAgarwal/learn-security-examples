- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability in the insecure example stems from the lack of logging and authentication. Without proper logging, it's challenging to trace actions 
back to the users who performed them. Additionally, without authentication, there's no reliable way to verify the identity of users making requests, 
further compounding the repudiation issue. In this scenario, any user can send messages or retrieve them without the system having any means to 
confirm their identity or log their activity in a way that ties them to their actions conclusively.

The secure version includes middleware that logs every request, including the method, URL, and the requester's IP address, as well as specific actions 
like sending messages and accessing messages.

Utilizing secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2, JWT, or sessions with strong session management practices. For critical actions, also consider 
requiring a digital signature.
