- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In the insecure version, the application takes an id parameter directly from the query string and uses it in a MongoDB query without validation or sanitization.
The secure version attempts to mitigate the risk of causing a service outage due to bad input by wrapping the database query in a try-catch block.

Explicitly validating inputs like the id to ensure they conform to expected formats can prevent attackers from submitting data that could lead 
to expensive queries or operations. Implementing rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a user can make to sensitive endpoints within a 
certain timeframe can also mitigate DoS attacks.
