Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability in the insecure version is susceptible to NoSQL injection, which could lead to unauthorized disclosure of information. The application 
accepts the username parameter directly from the user's request and inserts it into a MongoDB query without any form of validation or sanitization.

Information disclosure directly violates the Confidentiality aspect of CIA. When an application inadvertently exposes sensitive information due to a 
security vulnerability like NoSQL injection, it fails to maintain the confidentiality of that information.

By verifying that the username is a string, the application ensures that the input matches the expected format. The process of removing non-alphanumeric 
characters from the username input further protects against injection by limiting the characters that can be used to manipulate queries.
