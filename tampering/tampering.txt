Whens sending the message in the Get endpoint, the variable name is used. However, its not guaranteed that the value of the variable would always
be string. Instead it could have been tampered with to make it some custom JS code which could potentially be harmful to the server.
Then, in the register endpoint, the value of the name variable, which could have been JS code, could cause problems.

The secure version bypasses these problems by making the variable sanitized and removing any HTML code by escaping special characters through escapeHTML.
